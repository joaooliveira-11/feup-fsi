# Wordpress CVE

## Part 1

When navigating the website (http://ctf-fsi.fe.up.pt:5001), our initial objective was to find the WordPress version, which we pursued through two distinct methods. First, we appended '/feed' to the end of the link (http://ctf-fsi.fe.up.pt:5001/feed) as RSS feeds are automatically generated by WordPress. This allowed us to gain access to a specific resource. In the generator tag of the feed, we found out the WordPress version, which can be useful for assessing the site's security.

After, we found a product in the Shop page called WordPress Hosting. In the product page was a section named Additional Information where information about the WordPress and 2 plugins were displayed.

In the same page, we found a review from a user named Orval Sanford and an admin answer.

We then searched about each plugin and its version, specifically seeking out any associated CVE. During our investigation, we discovered a CVE(flag{CVE-2021-34646}) associated with the 'Booster for WooCommerce plugin 5.4.3'. This CVE exposes a vulnerability that enables malicious actors to gain unauthorized access as administrators.

## Part 2

After researching about this vulnerability, we found an exploit(https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/50299) that allowed us to bypass authentication and log in as admin in the website.

Using the script available in the exploit with the website's url and id 1 (usually the admin), that we found using https://target.com/wp-json/wp/v2/users/, 3 links were generated that allowed us to bypass the authentication and log in as admin in the target website.

Finally, after being logged in, we went to http://ctf-fsi.fe.up.pt:5001/wp-admin/edit.php and got access to private posts.

There, we found the flag for this week.
